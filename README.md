# Date, Time, and Location
The Blount County Nerd Group will meet at the Blount County Public Library on Saturdays at 3 PM starting June 4th.  
Contact information: garrett.smit7@gmail.com and kaleb@wowyourclient.com


# What you'll learn
Over this summer and through the upcoming school year, expect to learn the basics of making simple games, developing professional websites, and creating mobile apps.  Most importantly, however, you will gain many resources to help you to grow in any direction you want.  Questions are always encouraged.


# Who we are
## Garrett
> Hi, I’m Garrett Smith, and I go to Maryville High School.  I’ve been coding for about 3 years now, and I work with Kaleb in our web development business.  Some things I enjoy doing are playing piano, practicing violin, learning cello, and playing in the occasional game of ultimate frisbee or frisbee golf.  

## Kaleb
> I am Kaleb Davenport, and I am a student at William Blount transitioning to home school.  (Insert joke here). I have been coding for two years and have already helped in the development of three websites live on the web today.  I am a true nerd with interests in computers, rubik’s cubes, human psychology, and quantum science.  I have a passion for teaching, especially to people who want to learn!


# Who can come?
All students 7th grade and up that go to Blount County school or homeschool group are encouraged to come.  No prior programming knowledge is needed.  The group is **completely free for anyone to attend**.


# What to bring
We encourage you to bring technology devices including a laptop.  Power outlets will be available, so feel free to bring laptops with short-lasting batteries.  If, however, you do not have a laptop, the library has graciously provided laptops to use when necessary.
